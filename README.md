# Takeaways from deep learning summer school IADS22

This summer school took place from July 25 to August 6 2022. I attended a lot of courses on deep learning, including CNNs, RNNs, natural language processing, transformers and optimization.

In this repo I will apply the concepts I learnt in several small experiments. Here's an index of folders:

1. CNN folder:
> CNN_Minst.ipynb : Classify handwritten digits using a VGG-like convolutional NN from scratch [Keras]
> CNN_DogsVsCats.ipynb: Classify dogs vs cats using a VGG-like convolutiona NN from scratch [Keras]
> CNN_CovidClassification.ipynb: Detect covid cases from images [Keras]

2. CNN_tensorflow folder: 
> TensorflowBasics.ipynb: Implement feed forward neural nets from scratch in Tensorflow and use it in Iris and MINST dastet [Tensorflow]
> CNN_Minst.ipynb: Implement CNNs from scratch in Tensorflow and use them in MINST dataset [Tensorflow]

3. RNN folder:

4. RNN_tensorflow folder:

5. Transfer_learning folder:

6. Dataset_shift:

7. NLP_transformers:
